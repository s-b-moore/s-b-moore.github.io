# About me
Currently, I am a Research Assistant within the Department of Psychology at Durham University. I completed my PhD in 2023 within the School of Psychology at Keele University, supervised by [Professor Jim Grange](https://www.keele.ac.uk/psychology/people/jimgrange/) and [Dr Sara Spotorno](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/sara-spotorno/).

Prior to my current role, I held positions as a Statistician, Lecturer, and Teaching Fellow. My research interests include visual short-term memory, cognitive control, and auditory distraction. I also have interests in mathematical and computational modelling, Open Research, and programming (primarily R and Python).
